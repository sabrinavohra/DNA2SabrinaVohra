| 10/12 |  10:40 - 11:00am  | I started coding by writing the most basic solution that I could think of. I am writing a method to perform linear search, although I think it'll be too slow. |
| 10/12 |  11:00 - 11:30pm  |                      I ran the debugger and tested code to find errors with the current version of code and couldn't find what was making the values so large. |
| 10/12 | 11:30pm - 12:00am |                                                                                                      I continued to look for issues with my debugging process. |
| 10/13 |  9:30 - 10:00pm   |                                                             I realized I had forgotten a step to counting, so I started to debug for that part of the problem. |
| 10/13 |  10:00 - 10:30pm  | I made some extra if-statements and debugged. I'm much closer, but still slightly off. It might be an indexing error or I might have missed a small edge case. |
