| 10/12 |  10:40 - 11:00am   |                                                                                                                                     I started coding by writing the most basic solution that I could think of. I am writing a method to perform linear search, although I think it'll be too slow. |
| 10/12 |  11:00 - 11:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                          I ran the debugger and tested code to find errors with the current version of code and couldn't find what was making the values so large. |
| 10/12 | 11:30pm - 12:00am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I continued to look for issues with my debugging process. |
| 10/13 |   9:30 - 10:00pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                 I realized I had forgotten a step to counting, so I started to debug for that part of the problem. |
| 10/13 |  10:00 - 10:30pm   |                                                                                                                                     I made some extra if-statements and debugged. I'm much closer, but still slightly off. It might be an indexing error or I might have missed a small edge case. |
| 10/13 | 10:30pm -  11:00pm |                                                                                                                                                 I was able to pass the test cases for 2/5 tests. I think I must be slightly off for the other two. I debugged to find where those errors might be. |
| 10/13 |  11:00 - 11:05pm   | I switched the location of some code to see if the error might be in the placement of if-statements. I found that the other test cases became true, and the ones that were right before are now off by 1. I think it might be an issue with indexing or an issue with the linear search algorithm. |
| 10/13 |  11:05 - 11:15pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I wrote some of my ideas down for how to approach the problem more efficiently. |
| 10/18 |   9:25 - 9:55am    |                   I started working on the hash solution by creating a hashing method and building the STRcount() method around the hash method. I made how the hash method works slightly recursive, but didn't make the function itself recursive. To make the program work, I need to fix that. |
| 10/21 |  10:15 - 10:35pm   |                                                            I worked through errors I was having with incrementing the current part of the sequence I was looking at. I used the debugger to see where my incrementation went wrong. I'm now working through a problem with an out of bounds error. |
| 10/22 |  10:50 - 10:55am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried debugging by decomplicating the current substring I was looking at. |
