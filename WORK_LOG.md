| 10/12 |  10:40 - 11:00am  | I started coding by writing the most basic solution that I could think of. I am writing a method to perform linear search, although I think it'll be too slow. |
| 10/12 | 11:00pm - 12:00am |                      I ran the debugger and tested code to find errors with the current version of code and couldn't find what was making the values so large. |
